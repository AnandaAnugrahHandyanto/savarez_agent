## Reviewer Evaluation Criteria

Understanding what reviewers look for helps focus effort:

| Criterion | What They Check |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Quality** | Technical soundness, well-supported claims, fair baselines |
| **Clarity** | Clear writing, reproducible by experts, consistent notation |
| **Significance** | Community impact, advances understanding |
| **Originality** | New insights (doesn't require new method) |

**Scoring (NeurIPS 6-point scale):**
- 6: Strong Accept — groundbreaking, flawless
- 5: Accept — technically solid, high impact
- 4: Borderline Accept — solid, limited evaluation
- 3: Borderline Reject — weaknesses outweigh
- 2: Reject — technical flaws
- 1: Strong Reject — known results or ethics issues

See [references/reviewer-guidelines.md](references/reviewer-guidelines.md) for detailed guidelines, common concerns, and rebuttal strategies.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Abstract too generic | Delete first sentence if it could prepend any ML paper. Start with your specific contribution. |
| Introduction exceeds 1.5 pages | Split background into Related Work. Front-load contribution bullets. |
| Experiments lack explicit claims | Add: "This experiment tests whether [specific claim]..." before each one. |
| Reviewers find paper hard to follow | Add signposting, use consistent terminology, make figure captions self-contained. |
| Missing statistical significance | Add error bars, number of runs, statistical tests, confidence intervals. |
| Scope creep in experiments | Every experiment must map to a specific claim. Cut experiments that don't. |
| Paper rejected, need to resubmit | See Conference Resubmission in Phase 7. Address reviewer concerns without referencing reviews. |
| Missing broader impact statement | See Step 5.10. Most venues require it. "No negative impacts" is almost never credible. |
| Human eval criticized as weak | See Step 2.5 and [references/human-evaluation.md](references/human-evaluation.md). Report agreement metrics, annotator details, compensation. |
| Reviewers question reproducibility | Release code (Step 7.9), document all hyperparameters, include seeds and compute details. |
| Theory paper lacks intuition | Add proof sketches with plain-language explanations before formal proofs. See [references/paper-types.md](references/paper-types.md). |
| Results are negative/null | See Phase 4.3 on handling negative results. Consider workshops, TMLR, or reframing as analysis. |

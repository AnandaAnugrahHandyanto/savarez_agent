"""Guardrail: _create_openai_client must not mutate its input kwargs.

#10933 injected an httpx.Client directly into the caller's ``client_kwargs``.
When the dict was ``self._client_kwargs``, the shared transport was torn down
after the first request_complete close and subsequent request-scoped clients
wrapped a closed transport, raising ``APIConnectionError('Connection error.')``
with cause ``RuntimeError: Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed``
on every retry. That PR has since been reverted, but the underlying issue
(#10324, connections hanging in CLOSE-WAIT) is still open, so another transport
tweak inside this function is likely. This test pins the contract that the
function must treat its input dict as read-only.

#11249 reported the same class of bug: without the shallow-copy guard,
``_create_openai_client()`` wrote ``http_client`` back into the caller's dict,
so every subsequent ``dict(self._client_kwargs)`` shallow-copy shared the
*same* ``httpx.Client`` instance that was created for the primary client.
Closing any request-scoped OpenAI client would therefore also close the
primary's underlying transport, causing ``RuntimeError: Cannot send a request,
as the client has been closed`` on all calls after the first.  The fix —
``client_kwargs = dict(client_kwargs)`` at the top of the method — ensures
each invocation operates on an independent local copy.
